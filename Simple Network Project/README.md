1. Design a network in Cisco Packet Tracer that connects ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments through the following:
* Each department should contain at least two PCs.
* Appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
* Using the given network 192.168.40.0, all interfaces should be configured with correct IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
* All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.
* Test communication between devices in both ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.

2. Technologies Implemented
* Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch.
* Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.
* Connecting two Networks using a Router.
* Subnetting and IP Addressing.
* Assigning IP Addresses to Router's interfaces.
* Static IP Address allocation to Host Devices.
* Test and Verifying Network Communication.
